#### Customization

If you wanna do more customization and change code yourself, a [Grunt](gruntjs.com) environment is also included. (Thanks to Clean Blog.)

There are a number of tasks it performs like minification of the JavaScript, compiling of the LESS files, adding banners to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, and watching for changes. Run the grunt default task by entering `grunt ` into your command line which will build the files. You can use `grunt watch` if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESS.

**Try to understand code in `_include/` and `_layouts/`, then you can modify Jekyll [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template directly to do more creative customization.**


#### Header Image

Change header images of any pages or any posts is pretty easy as mentioned above. But, thanks to [issue #6 (in Chinese)](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io/issues/6) asked, **how to make it looks great?**

**Well...it is actually a design issue**, not a coding stuff. It is better that you have basic design knowledge, but not is ok, let me told you how to make it well-designed:

Seeing the title text above image is **white**, the image should be **dark** to emphasize the contract. so we can easily add a **black overlay with fews of opacity**, which is depends on the brightness of the original images you used. you can process it in Photoshop, Sketch etc.

In technical views, it can be done with CSS. However, the opacity of the black overlay is really hard to assigned, **every image has different brightness so the  degree it should be adjusted is different so it is impossible to hard code it.**
